# Student GPA MVC Project.

# Overview.
This Java project demonstrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern applied to managing student GPA data. It shows how to separate concerns:

Model: Manages student data and GPA calculations.

View: Displays GPA statistics.

Controller: Handles communication between Model and View.

The project calculates the average GPA of students and counts how many students have GPA above and below the average.
# Classes.
Student: Represents a student with name and gpa.

Model: Stores the list of students and provides methods for GPA average and counts.

View: Displays GPA average and counts of students above/below average.

Controller: Sets student data in the model and updates the view.

Main: Demonstrates the application by creating sample students and showing GPA stats.
